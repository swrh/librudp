/**

   @module {Client}
   @short Client implementation

   Client connects to a server.  As long as the connection is
   established, data can be exchanged both ways, either reliably or
   not.

   For connecting, It either uses an explicit constant IPv4 or IPv6
   address, or an hostname to resolve.

   Client contexts use the same @xref {olc} {life cycle} as other
   complex objects of the library.  Before use, client contexts must
   be initialized with @ref rudp_client_init, and after use, they must
   be cleaned with @ref rudp_client_deinit.

   An initialized but not yet connected Client context must have its
   server address setup with any of the following functions: @ref
   rudp_client_set_hostname, @ref rudp_client_set_ipv4 or @ref
   rudp_client_set_addr.

   Once the server address is setup properly, Client context can be
   connected with @ref rudp_client_connect.  After successful
   handshake with the server, the @ref rudp_client_handler::connected
   handler is called back.

   Either because of a connection timeout or because of server
   disconnection the @ref rudp_client_handler::server_lost handler
   is called back.

   Anytime afer call to @ref rudp_client_connect and until the @ref
   rudp_client_handler::server_lost handler is called, user may ask
   for disconnection with @ref rudp_client_close.

   Sample usage:
   @code
    // assuming you have a valid rudp context here:
    struct rudp *rudp;

    struct rudp_client client;

    rudp_client_init(&client, rudp, &my_client_handlers);

    // set the server address and connect
    rudp_client_set_ipv4(&client, ...);
    rudp_client_connect(&client);

    // run your event loop

    rudp_client_close(&client);
    rudp_client_deinit(&client);
   @end code
