/**

   @module {Address}
   @short Internet address (IPv4/IPv6) abstraction, with resolving

   Addresses are abstracted in the library.  Addresses are
   represented through the @ref rudp_address.

   Addresses are objects with the same @xref {olc} {life cycle} as
   most other complex objects of the library.  Before use, address
   structures must be initialized with @ref rudp_address_init, and
   after use, they must be cleaned with @ref rudp_address_deinit.

   Addresses may be set 3 ways:
   @list
     @item with a constant IPv4 address (@ref rudp_address_set_ipv4)
     @item with a constant IPv6 address (@ref rudp_address_set_ipv6)
     @item with an hostname to lookup (@ref rudp_address_set_hostname)
   @end list

   After the address is correctly setup, user code may use @ref
   rudp_address_get to retrieve a @tt {struct sockaddr} containing
   the address.

   In order to walk through the resolved addresses, user may call
   @ref rudp_address_next. This loops through the available addresses
   corresponding to an hostname.
